# USE Cases

<mark style="color:blue;">**Proof of Calibration ™ **</mark>

Create/mint a TOM NFT validation token upon the user wearing a TOM Flow Sensor and satisfying a combination of sensory parameter inputs to validate heart coherency with alignment of their intentions, transactions, responses or actions. The heart doesn’t lie. This validation will focus on sufficient heart coherency and low resistivity to determine degree of Calibration with your true alignment.&#x20;

[Proof of Calibration ™](../proof-of-calibration-tm.md) could be a simple Truth detector to validate the person is in alignment with their intentions, transactions or actions thus indicating calibration.&#x20;

[Proof of Calibration ™ ](../proof-of-calibration-tm.md)is a good indicator of trustful alignment with true self and therefore indicator of good intentions and win-win potential.&#x20;

[Proof of Calibration ™ ](../proof-of-calibration-tm.md)  may include the validation of multiple people, but never depends on group calibration as this could lead to calibration to others who may be out of calibration rather than true calibration with ideal true self.&#x20;



&#x20;The next question might be do you Token of Me blackpaper, October 28, 2021 page 4 really intend to sell this NFT? Is this authentic? Do you have the rights to upload this content? Do you really want to do this?
